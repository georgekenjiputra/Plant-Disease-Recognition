## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a model that accurately identifies and classifies unhealthy plants in order to improve plant health sensitivity. By detecting signs of deterioration or disease at an early stage, the model aims to enable farmers and agricultural professionals to take prompt and targeted actions, preventing further spread of diseases and optimizing crop yield and quality. Furthermore, the integration of this model into agricultural systems aims to provide real-time monitoring and valuable insights for decision-making, allowing farmers to optimize cultivation practices, adjust nutrient levels, and ensure overall crop well-being. The ultimate goal is to promote sustainable farming practices, reduce costs, and contribute to increased crop productivity and food security.

## Conclusion

Advancements in technology have transformed agriculture by improving plant health sensitivity. Our model accurately identifies and classifies unhealthy plants, enabling prompt action to prevent disease spread and optimize crop yield. It provides real-time monitoring and decision-making support for farmers to enhance cultivation practices, reduce costs, and promote sustainable farming practices.

However, the model may struggle with novel scenarios or significant variations from the training data, posing a challenge in generalization. To address this, gathering diverse training datasets, applying data augmentation, fine-tuning pre-trained models, and regularly evaluating performance are recommended. Additionally, incorporating domain-specific knowledge and staying updated with the latest research can further improve computer vision models in agriculture and other industries.
